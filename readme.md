# Cooltimedia
Cooltimedia should become a platform for managing personal media files and access them from everywhere. 
Nevertheless, this repository is developed only by myself and motivated by personal interest. So don't expect too much contributions on this project.

## Technology
This project is a PWA-ready Application built with Vaadin and Spring Boot. In the future there might get some additional Libraries for things like Authentication, ev. Hosting etc. 

# Installation
There is already Docker Support with a corresponding Docker-Compose config-file, but there are some known bugs in this Configuration. 
As soon I can release v1 of this repo, I'll fix those Issues.  

More detailed information coming soon...
